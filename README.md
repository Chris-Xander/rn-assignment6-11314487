This is a React Native component for a cart screen in an e-commerce application.

It displays a list of items in the cart, along with their images, names, types, and prices.

The total estimated cost of the items in the cart is also displayed. The user can delete items from the cart by pressing a delete button. The screen also includes a "Checkout" button at the bottom, which allows the user to proceed to the checkout process.

Additionally, the screen includes a logo, a search icon, and a navigation system that redirects the user to the home screen if the cart is empty.
